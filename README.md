# Overwatch

This is a repo that'll contain all the important scripts in order to run the Overwatch/FPS video analyzer.

ConvertVid.py is the video to image converted which converts the video to a series of frames. As of right now it will continue until a command is given for it to stop. It natively extracts ALL frames but will be revised to only capture every other frame.
